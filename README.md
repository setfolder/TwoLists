# TwoLists
Mouse-dragging list items made in TypeScript

**Install using command:**  
npm i

To edit and immediately see changes in the project:
1. Open the console in the project folder and issue the command:
npx tsc --watch
This will run TypeScript in watch mode, and every time you change and save .ts files, they will be automatically compiled into .js files. The console can be minimized to the tray.
1. Now you can edit .ts files with any text editor. For example, VSCode. When you save a .ts file after changes, they will be automatically compiled into .js files.
1. If VSCode is launched in browser/Node.js view mode, then when you change a .js file, the changes will be immediately visible in the project.
